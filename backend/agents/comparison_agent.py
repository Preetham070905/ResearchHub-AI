"""
Comparison Agent — performs cross-paper comparative analysis.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Individual paper summaries tell you what each paper does.
But researchers need to understand HOW papers relate to each other:
- Which methods overlap vs. diverge?
- What are the performance tradeoffs?
- What are common strengths/weaknesses across the field?

This agent takes the summaries from SummarizerAgent and produces
a side-by-side comparison matrix.
